# Weather-App
Weather App for SheCodes Plus Project
This project taught us the basics in understanding how an API works and to get more experience with JS functions. 
We used a free source (Open Weather) that provided free APIs and keys for us. 
I have had so many issues with this Open Weather site and getting errors of invalid keys. I definitely do not recommend this for anyone in the professional world. It is great for people trying to learn code though.
